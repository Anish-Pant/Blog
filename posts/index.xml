      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet relies on various protocols that enable communication between web browsers and servers. Two of the most essential protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure version, HTTPS. Understanding these protocols is crucial for ensuring secure and efficient web communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-http&#34;&gt;What is HTTP?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that facilitates communication between browsers and servers, allowing the transfer of hypertext  (web pages and other resources like text, images, videos, and multimedia) across the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Boot Procedure - How does a computer boot?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/bootprocedure/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The moment you press the power button, the computer powers on, and the the CPU (Central Processing Unit) starts up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the CPU is the &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; of the computer, it is not an input device. It needs instructions to determine what to do next, and it looks to a specific software for these instructions. That software is called &lt;em&gt;BIOS&lt;/em&gt; (Basic Input/Output System) or, in modern systems, &lt;em&gt;UEFI&lt;/em&gt; (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re sending a secret letter to a friend. You’d want to ensure that only they can read it, right? And you’d want to confirm it’s truly them receiving it, not someone pretending to be them. This is exactly what digital certificates do for the internet. Let’s break it down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital certificate functions like a passport for websites, servers, or even people. Just as your passport is issued by a trusted government authority, digital certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) such as Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert, or GoDaddy. These CAs verify the identity of the certificate holder before issuing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
